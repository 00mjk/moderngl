# Tutorials

The tutorials will cover basic and advanced rendering using ModernGL.

Numbered examples will be explained step by step. ModernGL is not about Window
creation, the **GLWindow** will be used most of the time, since it requires less
than 10 lines of code to create and update a window. PyQt5 is an alternative
and all the examples and maybe even the tutorials will be ported to **PyQt5** as well.

ModernGL can be used for windowless rendering as well. **GL2PS** will be
supported soon.

## Getting Started

***It is recommended that you use a virtual environment, but this is not
a strict necessity.***


To start using the examples within this folder, please run the following:

    python3.6 -m pip install -r requirements.txt


Note that you may also need to install the ModernGL.ext.obj library:

    python3.6 -m pip install ModernGL.ext.obj
    python3.6 -m ModernGL.ext --collect


Then run any of the examples.  Each example has a command-line interface
that can be accessed via:

    <filename> -h
